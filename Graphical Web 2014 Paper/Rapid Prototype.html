<!--
Site development is haphazard at best - some start by designing a page, others add pages to existing sites. 
Rarely is the navigability of the site considered. We have created a tool 
using SVG for the rapid prototyping of web site structures. 
The tool permits the user to design a web site by either a graph or via a 
spreadsheet. The user can create a graph that represents the connectivity of 
the web site and then export the structure to a skeleton website or import the 
structure into a spreadsheet. Or the user can create the web pages completely 
in the spreadsheet by specifying links, colors, images, and text for each page. 
Then the rapid prototype generates a test site for the user to walk through and
 see the structure. Researchers may then test the navigability of the site as a 
 function of various properties of connectivity.
 
The tool uses SVG, XML and simple spreadsheet
(http://www.simple-groupware.de/cms/spreadsheet/home  - 
an open-source spreadsheet software for use in browsers). 
It is built on Grapher (as previously presented at SVG Open 2009). 
Grapher is used to create graphs for page interconnections and generates 
XML code that can be input into the spreadsheet so that the designer can add data to pages.

This work also includes force-directed layout of the graphs to help visualize
both the connectivity and visitors' traffic in graphs.  Central to much of the 
design has been the use of graph theoretic metaphors for navigability, namely 
graph gravity, landmarks and vantage points. Previous work has shown that graph
gravity can be used to facilitate users' navigation of the connective structure of a web site.

The representation of a website in a spreadsheet format is not intuitive. However, representing a site in such a way can have major advantages when it comes to 
viewing the overall structure of the site and the contents of each page. For the representation to work every row on the spreadsheet represents a page on the website, or a node on a graph. The columns of the spreadsheet represent various attributes that a page can contain. These attributes include things like page name, edges or links to other pages, color of the page, and page content such as images. 
<br><br>
An open source project was used and adapted by the Slippery Rock University Virtual Gravity Group in order to meet the needs of the project. The original project was created by Simple Groupware and mostly functioned as a free, open-source alternative to a spreadsheet program like Excel, but browser based. In order to adapt the program for use within the Virtual Gravity Group a few things needed changed. Mainly the program needed to be able to interact and communicate with the pre-existing softwares created by the group; Grapher and Constructor. For this to occur the spreadsheet needed to be edited to create and accept Graph XML. The program also needed to perform some graph and website specific tasks, such as automatically removing edges to deleted rows.
